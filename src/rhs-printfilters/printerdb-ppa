           the "Fast text printing (non-PS printers only)" box. \

           These  drivers are for DeskJet 710C, 712C, 720C, 722C printers \ 
           which use HP's proprietary PPA protocol instead of PCL. \
           Postscript images are converted by ghostscript into \
           "Portable PixMap" (color) or "Portable BitMap" (black) formats \
           and then converted to PPA instructions by the pnm2ppa \
           post-processor. \
           (The older black-only pbm2ppa post-processor is also \
           provided as a legacy alternative.) \
           You may add PPA processor options \
           after a "PPA" separator in the "extra GS options" box,\
           in the format: " gs_options PPA ppa_options "; \
           type "pnm2ppa -h" or "pbm2ppa -h" to list the options. \
          \ 
          The primary site for the PPA driver is the pnm2ppa \ 
          project at http://sourceforge.net/projects/pnm2ppa .\
