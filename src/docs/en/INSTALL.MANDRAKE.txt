  Information about using  pnm2ppa with Mandrake. (Updated for
  pnm2ppa-1.04 and later.)

  See the document INSTALL.REDHAT.html for installation and setup.  That
  document is written for Red Hat; note the Mandrake-specific
  differences listed below,


  +o  Mandrake 7.0 and earlier has incompatible and non-functional
     pnm2ppa support which must be  replaced.  Please use printtool to
     delete any installed PPA printers   BEFORE upgrading rhs-
     printfilters.  (If you forget to do this, and printtool will not
     start after the update, delete or move your /etc/printcap file.)
     Install the pnm2ppa RPM package.  Then update rhs-printfilters with
     rhs-printfilters-1.58-4ppa5mdk.i386.rpm from
     http://sourceforge.net/projects/pnm2ppa.  (Do  NNOOTT use rhs-
     printfilters-1.57-4ppa4.i386.rpm which is for RedHat systems only.)

  +o  Mandrake-7.1 supplies a pnm2ppa RPM  and has support for it in rhs-
     printfilters.   Mandrake 7.1 has a configuration tool DrakConf for
     setting up printers, which may be an interface to printtool.  Some
     users have reported difficulties with this.  In that case, just use
     printtool to configure the printer.

  +o  Mandrake-7.2  does not have a separate pnm2ppa RPM package, but has
     added  pnm2ppa to the ghostscript RPM package.  This creates
     difficulties for updating pnm2ppa with the RPM package from
     http://sourceforge.net/projects/pnm2ppa.  You will get reported
     conflicts with ghostscript if you try to install the
     pnm2ppa-1.04-1.i386.rpm package, but it seems that you can safely
     use the rpm  option --force to force its installation.
     Mandrake-7.2 also has moved to using CUPS as its printing system,
     and appears to now have its own printer configuration tool, but
     still includes pnm2ppa support in rhs-printfilters.
