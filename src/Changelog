20000306        duncan  Lots of  little fixes; --fd working right now;
                        bidirectional shearing adjustments added (user
                        configurable entries "blackshear" and colorshear"
                        in pnm2ppa.conf.
20000311	duncan 	added : -B n option and "blackness n" config file
			entry to control black ink density (drops per
			pixel n = 0,1,2,3,4 ) default is 2.  Also there are
			now config file entries blackshear and colorshear
			for adjusting shearing in bidirectional printing.
			Fixed various bugs that broke HP820/1000 printing.
20000318	duncan	Color EcoMode printing now uses bidirectional
			printsweeps   (formerly only FastMode did this)
                        If gMaxPass = 1, you now get bidirectional sweeps
                        (in cut_im_color_swath() , cutswath.c)
20000326        duncan	** changes to dither.c: 
			on odd lines, black is
                        now processed (not color), even black pixels are 
			duplicated, so if either of two successive pixels are 
			black, they both are.  Changes also fix Tim's report
			about blurry black/white boundaries.
			** changes to image.c
			If the odd line is not printed
			(PixMap or EcoMode), image.c now stores the line, and 
			adds the black parts to the next even line.  
			This fixes a bug in where thin (one-pixel wide) black 
			lines (like enscript borders) could be lost because 
			black ink only printed  every second pixel, and odd 
			black lines were just copies of the preceeding even 
			line which had been stored.   
20000331	duncan	added support for large papersizes 11x17 and a3
			(for the 1000 series printers).  Added a 
			printer-specific max_pagewidth so papersizes that
			are too wide for a printer series will not print
			on that printer.
20000402	duncan	tweaked bidirectional sweep shearing correction.
			(removed the +1 right-to-left black shift in
			cut_im_black_swath() in cutswath.c  ).
                        I am not sure if the shearing correction is
			model or individual printer-specific. (I suspect
			the second case, in which case it is a calibration
                        issue (The HP Win9x software seems to have calibration
                        adjustments for blackshear.)  if any corrections
                        turn out to be generic to a given printer family,
			(rather than specific to a particular printer)
                        the default can be changed in defaults.h (the
                        variables are:
				printer->r2l_bw_offset    (=blackshear)
                        	printer->r2l_color_offset (=colorshear).
20000404	duncan	added support for pbmraw and pgmraw formats.
			all three pnmraw formats now work.
                        (changes in image.c, image.h )
20000405	duncan  added support for pgm, ppm, pbm  nonraw formats.
			added papersize autoconfiguring from the pnm
			header, so all ghostscript papersizes are now
                        supported (if the printer can accomodate them)
                        The -s option now only controls the gammafile
			creation papersize.     Made bidirectional
			printing the default (but this can be configured
                        with a "unimode 1" in pnm2ppa.conf, or --uni,
			--bi command line options.
20000408	duncan	graceful termination of print run if  pnm
			input is truncated (i.e., if read_line()
          		encounters EOF).  printer no longer hangs.
			Moved text strings to lang.h/text-en.h
20000423        duncan  clean up way things near sides of swath are
			handled in cutswath.c
20000710        duncan  in FS_Color_Dither(), use line[]= (1,1,1)
			not (0,0,0) for black replacement of dark
			pixels for which no color match is found.
			(fixes flashing LED on certain images - those with
			no black - with --eco on HP820)
                        (0,0,0) = black ink, (1,1,1) = gMaxPass drops of
                        each color.
20000928	duncan	in cutswath.c, if  the vertical position
			of the black and color sweeps differed by 1 , 2 or 3
                        dots, HP820 got "flashing light syndrome".
			Fixed by testing for this possibility, and
			if found, by reducing numlines, and padding the top
			of a swath with an (even) number of blank lines
			to  keep the height the same.
			(Thanks to Steven Elliott <selliott4@austin.rr.com>
                        for reporting this bug, and testing the fix.
20001010	ajv	made input of paths to gamma and config files secure
			against buffer overruns.   
	        duncan  In -g mode, check that gamma.ppm is not a symbolic
			link, and is a regular file, before writing to it
                        (but after opening it).

20001018        duncan 	clean up calibration program.  now called 
			calibrate_ppa.  It does most calibration now.

			moved the job of writing gamma.ppm for color 
			calibration to a new utility calibrate_ppa.c.  
			pnm2ppa -g now just prints the corresponding 
			test page. 		

			secured syslog messages.   No user input is
			sent to syslog.  syslog messages are wrapped, and can
                        be suppressed with a new keyword "silent 1"
			in /etc/pnm2ppa.conf  (but not in subsequently-read
			config files). all syslog activity now occurs
                        in syslog.c.
20001106		reduce memory footprint of calibrate_ppa
                        (it was 36MB!).
20001112                fix syslog silent/verbose usage; fix alignment
                        pattern bug in calibrate_ppa.  repaired the HP820
                        fix that got broken when the vertical offset was
                        redefined by 600 dots...
